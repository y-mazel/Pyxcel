2018-11-08 update

What's new:

Clean Python 2 reinstall on the development PC : Python 2.7.15 32 bits version + PyQt4.11.4-32bits.
For PyQt4 to be functionning, Python2 & PyQt4 both need to be 32 bits.
Some bugs seem to have disappeared following the reinstallation.

2018-10-25 update

What's new:

Bug correction:
_Database could not be saved if path contained non-ascii characters (eg: é,...), it is now compatible with the utf-8 unicode set
_log2d cost function was bugged, XRR fits should be more consistant from now on
_Bug Identification : first line of the XRF data files must not contain '.' (decimal point character), use a header line
_Compound units (g/cm3) induced a bug when trying to save a database, they are now supported

2018-10-23 update

What's new:

Bug correction:
_Fixed error in log2d optimization (XRR)
_XRR / GiXRF instruments units are back
_Units added in the labels of the stack editor column headers
_Simulations could be saved on the local drive but not the network, it is now functional for both

What's new:

Full English translation. Language preference, which lead to partial translations, has been removed.

2018-06-19 update

What's new:

Database save restored.
Minor fixes regarding displayed significant figures.

To do:

Conversion to Python 3 + pyQt 5 for cleaner user interface.

2018-06-01 update

What's new:

The fitting of multiple stoichiometric coefficients on the same material was bugged, it is now operational.
Recall of fitted parameters after a database was saved and reopened was not functionning, it is now operational.
Most occuring typos have been corrected.
FOMs graphics now only display integer x values (iteration axis).
Application icon has been added so that Medepy (or PyXCEL) is now easier to spot on the Windows taskbar.

2018-05-17 update

What's new:

Import of old databases is now operational (infinite values issue fixed).
Some menus would not open in the previous compiled version, the problem has been fixed.

To do:
Executable directory is still too large.

2018-03-29 update

What's new:

Following conflicts between Java versions required by Eyelit & Eclipse, an executable file has been created.
Eclipse, and thus a recent Java version, are not required anymore to run Medepy. 
_At this point, only Medepy contributors should get the source code (ie: everything except the "Medepy_xxx_build.7z" archive). 
_Regular Medepy users should only open the "Medepy_xxx_build.7z" and unpack it on their local drive. Medepy is launched with "main.exe".
.7z files open with 7-zip file manager (available in Centre Logiciel located on your Windows Desktop).
Libraries installation is not required for the end users.

Notes :

_Build has been compressed in a .7z archive due to long file names limitation on S:\.
_Source code compilation (freezing) using cx_freeze.
Usage : <in a terminal @ medepy src directory> python setup.py build
Hint : if python 2 & 3 are installed on your computer, you can force python 2 compilation (which is necessary) with :
<in a terminal @ medepy src directory> py -2 setup.py build

To do :

"build" directory is pretty large (~760 MB) due to the inclusion of unnecessary librairies.
"build/lib" directory should be skimmed to the minimum required in forthcoming versions.

What's new:

_Stoichiometry fitting is functional.
_Density and stoichiometry profiles are functional (how to in user manual).
_Scipy optimization was converging earlier than expected in previous versions.
In this version scipy is forced to complete the desired number of iterations.
Scipy optimization should now be preferred over inspyred.
Starting from this Medepy version, scipy libraries should be updated to support
this feature (see notes below).
_X-ray standing waves field is functional (how to in user manual).

Installation:

Copy the Medepy folder on your hard drive to prevent any modification of the backup archive.
Install in Eclipse via File->Import->Import Projects from File System or Archive and point
on your local copy of the Medepy folder.

Notes:

How to upgrade Scipy:
The easiest way to upgrade scipy as well as its dependancies (numpy, ...) is to use pip,
the built-in python package manager (Python 2 >= 2.7.9, Python 3 >= 3.4).
Open a terminal: (Windows key + R), type "cmd" to open a terminal.
If Python 2.7 is installed in the default installation folder, it should be located in
C:\Python27, pip is located in the Scripts subfolder. Adapt the following command line
depending on your Python 2 installation folder.
In the terminal, type or copy/paste "C:\Python27\Scripts\pip install scipy –upgrade"
(omitting the quotation marks) and press ENTER. Scipy and its dependancies will automatically 
be upgraded to their latest stable version.
